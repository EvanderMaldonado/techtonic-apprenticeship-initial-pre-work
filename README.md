### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**

### Basic JavaScript
 **Replace loops using Recursion**
- In this section I struggled with getting used to not having to write out the loop it felt like something was missing by not seeing a loop there, but the more I practiced using the recursion I started to really like it and understand it's concept it made everything easier to write and it made the coding go faster.

### Basic JavaScript
**Nesting for loops**
- In this section I was having issues with my spacing  it wasn't issues with understanding the code but with were I was putting my spaces I was probably stuck on it for almost 10 minutes but it was all just because I had an extra space between arr.lenght which wasn't letting the code function correctly.
